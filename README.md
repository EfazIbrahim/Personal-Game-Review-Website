# **Project Overview**
This is a project that I made to learn the basic fundamentals of React and web development. It is primarily made using Typescript and the React Framework. I used Chakra UI to style it as well. The website take data from the RAWG database using API's to display a list of the most popular games. From this list users can search up games basen on genre or name to see my review of it. This website was a passion project of mine and thus is not currently deployed.
